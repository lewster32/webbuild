This is largely a learning exercise to get into the nitty gritty of how Ken Silverman's Build engine works. I spent my formative PC years making maps for Duke Nukem 3D and it's a fantastic opportunity to revisit that 20+ years later and delve into the nuts and bolts of it.

Demo (updated when I remember) here: http://rotates.org/webbuild/
